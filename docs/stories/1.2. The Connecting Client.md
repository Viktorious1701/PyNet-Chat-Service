# Story 1.2: The Connecting Client

### Status

### Story
**As a** User,
**I want** to run a `client.py` script that connects to the server's IP and port,
**so that** I can establish a channel for communication.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  A new file named `client.py` is created.
2.  The script connects to `127.0.0.1` on port `5050`.
3.  If the server is running, the client prints "Connected to server successfully."
4.  If the server is **not** running, the client prints a user-friendly error message (e.g., "Could not connect. Is the server running?") instead of crashing with a raw stack trace.
5.  The script keeps the connection open (using a loop or input prompt) rather than exiting immediately.

### Dev Notes
*   **Architecture:** This uses the client-side socket workflow: `socket()` -> `connect()`.
*   **Error Handling:** Use `try...except ConnectionRefusedError` to handle cases where the server is offline.
*   **Verification:** You must have `server.py` running in a separate terminal to test the success case.
