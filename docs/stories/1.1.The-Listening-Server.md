# Story 1.1: The Listening Server

### Status
- [ ] Draft
- [X] **Approved**
- [ ] InProgress
- [ ] Review
- [ ] Done

### Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** to create a `server.py` that can listen for incoming TCP connections on a specified port,
**so that** clients have a stable endpoint to connect to.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  A new file named `server.py` is created.
2.  When executed (`python server.py`), the script starts without errors.
3.  The server successfully binds to a host IP (`127.0.0.1`) and a port (`5050`).
4.  The server enters a listening state, ready to accept future connections.
5.  A confirmation message, such as "Server is listening on 127.0.0.1:5050", is printed to the console upon successful startup.

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create the `server.py` file.
- [ ] Import the `socket` library.
- [ ] Define constants for the `HOST` and `PORT`.
- [ ] Create a new TCP/IP socket object.
- [ ] Use a `try...finally` block to ensure the socket is always closed on exit.
- [ ] Bind the socket to the host and port.
- [ ] Call the `listen()` method on the socket to enable connection acceptance.
- [ ] Add the confirmation print statement.
- [ ] For this story, the server should listen but does not need to accept connections yet. An infinite loop (`while True: pass`) can be used to keep the script running.

### Dev Notes
*   **Source Document:** `prd.md`, `architecture.md`
*   **Requirement Compliance:** This story directly addresses **FR1** (Connection) and **NFR3** (Standard Library).
*   **Architecture:** The socket MUST be a TCP socket (`socket.AF_INET`, `socket.SOCK_STREAM`).
*   **Configuration:** Use `HOST = '127.0.0.1'` (localhost) and `PORT = 5050` as per technical assumptions. These should be defined as constants at the top of the file for easy modification.
*   **Goal:** The sole purpose of this story is to create the "listening" part of the server. The logic for handling client connections (`accept()`) will be implemented in Story 1.3.
